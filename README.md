## Installation

```shell
npm i react-farcaster-embed
# or
yarn add react-farcaster-embed
# or
pnpm add react-farcaster-embed
```

## Usage

### Server Components

Add these imports inside your server component:

```jsx
import { FarcasterEmbed } from "react-farcaster-embed";
import "react-farcaster-embed/dist/styles.css"; // include default styles or write your own


// use warpcast url
<FarcasterEmbed url="https://warpcast.com/pugson/0x4294c797" />

// or username and hash of the cast
<FarcasterEmbed username="dwr" hash="0x48d47343" />
```

### Client Components

Add the CSS import inside `_app.tsx` if you are using Next.js Pages Router:

```tsx
import "@/styles/globals.css";
import "react-farcaster-embed/dist/styles.css";
import type { AppProps } from "next/app";

export default function App({ Component, pageProps }: AppProps) {
  return <Component {...pageProps} />;
}
```

And then use the component in your client component using a special import:

```jsx
import { FarcasterEmbed } from "react-farcaster-embed/dist/client";

// use warpcast url
<FarcasterEmbed url="https://warpcast.com/pugson/0x4294c797" />

// or username and hash of the cast
<FarcasterEmbed username="dwr" hash="0x48d47343" />
```

## Styling

The embed will inherit your body color by default when you import the default stylesheet.

You can change the color of the component by changing its parent's color or adding custom CSS:

```css
.farcaster-embed-container {
  color: purple;
}
```

## Custom Endpoint

In case you need to self host the Warpcast Client API proxy, you can [fork this repo](https://github.com/pugson/farcaster-api-proxy) and set the `customEndpoint` option in the `FarcasterEmbed` component.

Easiest way to do this is to make a wrapper component with that option applied. Example:

```jsx
import { FarcasterEmbed as FCEmbed } from "react-farcaster-embed";

export const FarcasterEmbed = (props) => (
  <FCEmbed
    {...props}
    options={{
      customEndpoint: "https://your-endpoint.xyz/api/casts",
    }}
  />
);
```

Casts will be fetched from your custom proxy instead of the default one using this URL structure. Make sure your proxy supports it.

```jsx
await fetch(`${options?.customEndpoint}/${username}/${hash}`);
```
